# Gamer Analysis
## Background
As a gamer myself I've spent some time trying to find a new game to play once I grew tired of my old favorite. However, often the time I spend searching does not yeld a perfect result. What if you could draw insights from other gamers and what games they like? 

## Objective
I will use Steam gamer data to draw insights and build a model who will recomend a new game based on my previous favorite game. 

I collected my data from https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games
